## Overview

This project implements a simple linear regression model using Python as part of the Data Analytics internship at CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS. It demonstrates the process of creating a model, training it on a dataset, evaluating its performance, and visualizing the results.

The project covers the following steps:
1. Generating a synthetic dataset
2. Splitting the data into training and testing sets
3. Training a linear regression model
4. Evaluating the model's performance
5. Visualizing the results

## Requirements

This project requires Python 3.6+ and the following libraries:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows these steps:

1. Data Generation: Creates a synthetic dataset with a linear relationship and some added noise.
2. Data Splitting: Uses train_test_split to divide data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
3. Model Training: Creates a LinearRegression model and fits it to the training data.
4. Prediction and Evaluation: Makes predictions on the test set and evaluates using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score.
5. Visualization: Plots the regression line against actual data points and creates a scatter plot of actual vs. predicted values.

## Results

Upon execution, the script outputs:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared score
- Two plots:
  1. Regression line with actual data points
  2. Actual vs. Predicted values scatter plot

These results help in understanding the model's performance and how well it fits the data.

## How to Run

To run this project:

1. Ensure all required libraries are installed.
2. Open the Python script in your preferred IDE or text editor.
3. Run the script to see the results and visualizations.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a practical implementation of linear regression for predictive modeling. It demonstrates key concepts in data splitting, model training, evaluation, and result visualization. The skills and knowledge gained from this project are valuable in the field of Data Analytics and can be applied to more complex real-world datasets and problems.
